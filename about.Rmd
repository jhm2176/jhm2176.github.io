I am a public health student, researcher, and thinker with a particular interested in transgender community health. I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Health in the Sociomedical Sciences department at Columbia University. My certificate is in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. I also work as a research assistant for the [TURNNT](https://www.turnnt.com/) study.

Before arriving at Columbia, I grew up in San Jose, CA with my mom, dad, sisters, and puppy. My first love was basketball, which I played throughout high school and almost into college down south. Instead, I retired my jersey in 2016 and attended UC Berkeley up the road, where I earned my BA in Public Health. It was here that I fell in love again, this time with public health, and decided to continue my education at Columbia.
